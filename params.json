Once you have ensured you have a working installation of\r\nRuby and Ruby gems, install the gem as follows from the command line:\r\n\r\n    % gem install examdown\r\n\r\nNow you can use the `examdown` input type with the Kramdown Markdown\r\nlibrary from your Ruby scripts:\r\n\r\n    require 'kramdown'\r\n    require 'examdown'\r\n    puts Kramdown::Document.new(ARGV[0], input: 'examdown').to_html\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nExamdown takes code blocks in Markdown documents and injects the code's\r\noutput back into the original script. This allows you to include examples of\r\nshell scripts in your document and include the dynamically generated output\r\nof those scripts.\r\n\r\n### Defining runnable code blocks\r\n\r\nDefine a regular code block in your Markdown file. Then add some special properties\r\nusing YAML front matter:\r\n\r\n    Here is some code:\r\n\r\n        ---\r\n        language: sh\r\n        ---\r\n        % echo \"foo\"\r\n\r\n    Pretty neat, eh?\r\n\r\nThis example gets converted to (roughly) the following output:\r\n\r\n    <p>Here is some code:</p>\r\n\r\n    <pre class=\"language-sh\"><code>% echo \"foo\"\r\n    foo\r\n    </code></pre>\r\n\r\n    <p>Pretty neat, eh?</p>\r\n\r\n### YAML front matter options\r\n\r\nThe following keys are read from the YAML front matter and used:\r\n\r\n* `language` defines the language of the code sample and thus how\r\n  it should be run. Currently, only `sh` is accepted as value.\r\n  This value is also added as class name for the wrapper element.\r\n* `before` contains an array of lines of code that should be run\r\n  before the example but not included in the final output.\r\n\r\n### Supported languages\r\n\r\nSee `Example` for a list of supported code runners.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n#### Specify custom Kramdown parser\r\n\r\n    Kramdown::Document.new(content, input: 'examdown').to_html\r\n\r\n#### Have code run to include its output\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    language: sh\r\n    ---\r\n    % echo foo\r\n\r\n#### Using before steps\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    language: sh\r\n    before:\r\n      - cp /path/to/my-file\r\n    ---\r\n    % cat my-file\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nSee the inline [API docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/avdgaag/examdown/master/frames) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n### Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project.\r\n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version\r\n   unintentionally.\r\n4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have\r\n   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can\r\n   ignore when I pull)\r\n5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues, defects or suggestions in the [Github issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/avdgaag/examdown/issues).\r\n\r\n### What has changed?\r\n\r\nSee the [HISTORY](https://github.com/avdgaag/examdown/blob/master/HISTORY.md) file for a detailed changelog.\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\nCreated by: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\nURL: [http://arjanvandergaag.nl](http://arjanvandergaag.nl)  \r\nProject homepage: [http://avdgaag.github.com/examdown](http://avdgaag.github.com/examdown)  \r\nDate: november 2013  \r\nLicense: [MIT-license](https://github.com/avdgaag/examdown/LICENSE) (same as Ruby)\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
